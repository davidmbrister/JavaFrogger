# Java Frogger
A simple Frogger implementation that relies on a simple grid defined in a game config file. 
Later commits were never merged into master, so most game features appear in branches other than master, including add addFlies branch which adds flies.
If I want to download and run this, I think my best branch bet would be to clone addFlies.
